##Google Chinese Results Blocklist

Google hasn't been optimizing its Chinese search results for a while, and a lot of spam sites have taken the advantage of it. 

When users search Google in Chinese, there will be numerous spam sites coming out in search results. 

So, I made this spam sites blacklist and will update this list as frequent as I can.

You can import this list to "[Google Personal Blocklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef)" or other tools like "[Google Hit Hider by Domain](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/1682-google-hit-hider-by-domain-search-filter-block-sites)" (highly recommended).
