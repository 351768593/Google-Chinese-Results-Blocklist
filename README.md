You can import this list to "[Google Personal Blocklist ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef)" or other tools like "[Google Hit Hider by Domain](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/1682-google-hit-hider-by-domain-search-filter-block-sites)" (highly recommended).
